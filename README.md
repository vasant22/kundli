# कुंडली / Kundli — Vedic Birth Chart Web App

Free, static, browser-only Vedic astrology (Kundli / जन्मपत्री) app for **mybapuji.com**.
All calculations run in the visitor's browser — **no backend, no database, no API keys, no tracking**.

| Item | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Chart styles | North Indian & South Indian (toggle) |
| Language | Hindi (default) + English |
| Ayanamsa | Lahiri (sidereal), whole-sign houses |
| Ephemeris | Swiss Ephemeris via WebAssembly (`swisseph-wasm`, Moshier mode) |
| Place search | Open-Meteo Geocoding (free, no key) |
| License | AGPL-3.0 |

## Status

**Phases 1–8 complete** — Vite scaffold with Swiss Ephemeris WASM verified; input form (validation, month chips, Hindi ⇄ English toggle); place search (Open-Meteo) with manual fallback; local→UTC conversion with historical timezone rules; sidereal Lahiri calculations verified end-to-end; bilingual data lists + self-hosted Devanagari font; SVG North & South Indian charts with toggle; full results page (bilingual table, PNG/Print/Copy). (53 tests, `npm test`)
The full app is built in phases (see `NOTES.md`); testing & accuracy validation, performance and deployment follow next.

## Development

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run dev      # start dev server -> http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build into dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally
```

> **Note:** opening `index.html` directly from disk (`file://...`) shows a blank page —
> the whole UI is rendered by JavaScript and must be served. Always view the app via
> `npm run dev` (or `npm run preview`) and open the printed local address.
